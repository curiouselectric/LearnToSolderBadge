LearnToSolderBadge
==================

KiCAD files for a couple of simple Learn-to-solder flashing LED badges. Done for Nottingham Hackspace.
The KiCAD projects are available and also the gerber files for PCB production.

There are two versions of the learn to solder badge:

Circle Badge - a simple circular PCB.
Robot Badge - a robot shaped PCB with surface mount options.

There are also notes and datasheets on the parts required and where to get them from.

These were designed by Matt Little (matt@re-innovation.co.uk) for doing soldering workshops at Nottingham Hackspace.
